This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`getAvailableVehicles` an `getValidPlanets` are the most important functions in
the app because they control which dropdowns and radio groups are rendered.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The browser will warn that the SSL certificate is untrusted because it is
self-signed, you can ignore the warning the proceed. This app calls REST API's
that use https, so the frontend must be https as well.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
